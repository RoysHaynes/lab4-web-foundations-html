# Lab 4 Web Foundations HTML

## Overview
This lab explores a wide range of HTML elements to help build literacy for first time HTML users. This is a so called "walk of my property" to 
help familiarize ourselves with HTML. 

## Project Goals
By the end of this lab, we have:
- A “kitchen sink” HTML page (`index.html`) with 60+ unique tags.
- Clean, valid HTML verified with the W3C Validator.
- Documentation of deprecated and skipped tags.
- A custom HTML element (`<my-school>`) defined and registered.
- Demonstration of attributes, data-* usage, inline styles, and scripts.
- Publication of the project via **GitHub Pages**.


## Issues & Nuances
1) I wanted to test acronym to see if it still works since it has been replaced by abbr. As such it does not pace the validator.
2) Skipped The bigger text element because the feature is no longer recommended
3) Skipped The centered text element because the feature is no longer recommended 
4) Skipped The directory element because the feature is no longer recommended
5) Skipped the font element because the feature is no longer recommended. 
6) The Marquee element is fun to have, so I included it, but it will not pass a checker.
7) Skipped the strike element because the feature is no longer recommended.
8) Skipped the teletype text element because the feature is no longer recommended
